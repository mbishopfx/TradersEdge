Moreover, oscillators on the daily chart are holding deep in negative territory and are still away from being in the oversold zone. This, in turn, suggests that the path of least resistance for spot prices remains to the downside. Hence, any subsequent recovery beyond the 147.00 mark (61.8% Fibo. level) might be seen as a selling opportunity and remain capped near the 147.70 region. This is followed by the 148.00 round figure, which if cleared decisively might trigger a near-term short-covering rally. On the flip side, the 146.00 mark, followed by the 145.45 region, the 145.00 psychological mark Asian session low, around the 144.80 region, and a multi-month trough, around the 144.55 region touched on Friday, could act as immediate support levels.

This further contributes to the USD/JPY pair's slide back closer to the 145.00 psychological mark. Japanese Yen bulls have the upper hand amid the US"
